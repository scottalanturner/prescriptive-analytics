    "\n",
    "This example combines:\n",
    "1. **Discrete Decisions**: Which facilities to open (binary) and how many machines to buy (integer)\n",
    "2. **Integer Constraints**: Facilities are yes/no (binary), machines are whole numbers (integer)\n",
    "3. **Feasibility Challenges**: Tight constraints can make the problem infeasible with integers\n",
    "4. **Discrete Tradeoffs**: Cost vs capacity tradeoffs are stepped, not smooth\n",
    "5. **Solution Interpretation**: Solutions are discrete choices that must be validated\n",
    "6. **Over-constraining**: Too many tight constraints can eliminate all feasible solutions\n"

    "## Summary: All Concepts Integrated\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive example demonstrates how all Lesson 7 concepts work together:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Discrete vs Continuous Decisions:**\n",
    "- Facilities: Binary (open/closed) - cannot partially open\n",
    "- Machines: Integer (whole numbers) - cannot buy fractional machines\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Integer Constraints in Modeling:**\n",
    "- Used binary variables for facility decisions\n",
    "- Used integer variables for machine purchases\n",
    "- Combined both types in one model\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Feasibility Challenges:**\n",
    "- Tight constraints can make the problem infeasible\n",
    "- Integer constraints reduce feasible options\n",
    "- Must balance constraints carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Discrete Tradeoffs:**\n",
    "- Cost vs capacity tradeoff is stepped, not smooth\n",
    "- Gaps exist where certain tradeoff levels are impossible\n",
    "- Cannot fine-tune tradeoffs the way you can with continuous decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Interpreting Integer Solutions:**\n",
    "- Solutions are discrete choices (whole numbers)\n",
    "- Cannot adjust by small amounts\n",
    "- Must validate that solutions are implementable\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Over-constraining:**\n",
    "- Too many tight constraints can eliminate all feasible solutions\n",
    "- Must be careful about constraint tightness with integer variables\n",
    "- May need to relax constraints to find feasible solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:**\n",
    "Discrete optimization requires different thinking than continuous optimization. You must recognize when decisions are discrete, model them correctly, understand the limitations of discrete solutions, and communicate them effectively to stakeholders.\n"
