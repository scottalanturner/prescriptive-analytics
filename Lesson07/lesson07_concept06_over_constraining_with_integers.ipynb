        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Over-constraining is worse with integers**: Discrete decisions have fewer feasible options, making constraints more likely to conflict.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Continuous vs Integer feasibility**: A problem feasible with continuous variables can be infeasible with integer variables because you cannot make fractional adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Recognizing over-constraining**: \n",
        "   - Check if minimum requirements exceed available resources\n",
        "   - Visualize feasible regions (continuous = large, integer = small)\n",
        "   - Test if relaxing constraints makes the problem feasible\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Fixing over-constraining**:\n",
        "   - Relax constraint values (e.g., reduce minimum requirements)\n",
        "   - Remove less critical constraints\n",
        "   - Increase available resources (e.g., increase budget)\n",
        "   - Prioritize constraints and relax less important ones\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Why this matters**:\n",
        "   - Over-constrained models waste time and effort\n",
        "   - They produce no solutions (infeasible)\n",
        "   - Understanding over-constraining helps you build better models\n",
        "   - It helps you recognize when constraints need to be relaxed\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common Signs of Over-constraining:**\n",
        "- ❌ Model status is \"Infeasible\"\n",
        "- ❌ Minimum requirements exceed available resources\n",
        "- ❌ Multiple tight constraints that conflict with each other\n",
        "- ❌ Problem is feasible with continuous but infeasible with integer variables\n",
        "\n",
        "**Best Practices:**\n",
        "- Start with essential constraints only\n",
        "- Test feasibility as you add constraints\n",
        "- Be willing to relax less critical constraints\n",
        "- Recognize that integer constraints make over-constraining more dangerous\n"
