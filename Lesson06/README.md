## Core Concepts

### 1. Networks as Nodes and Links
- Networks model systems with connections and flows
- Nodes represent locations, facilities, or decision points
- Links represent connections, routes, or relationships

### 2. Flow and Capacity
- Flows represent movement through networks
- Capacity constraints limit flows
- Understanding flow and capacity is essential for network optimization

### 3. Bottlenecks
- Bottlenecks limit network performance
- Identifying bottlenecks helps improve network efficiency
- Bottlenecks reveal where investments are most valuable

### 4. Network Tradeoffs
- Network optimization involves tradeoffs between cost, service, and capacity
- Improving one aspect often requires sacrificing another
- Models help navigate these tradeoffs

### 5. Interpreting Network Solutions
- Network solutions show flows, routes, and utilization
- Understanding solutions requires network context
- Solutions must be communicated clearly to stakeholders

### 6. Supply Chain Networks
- Supply chains are networks of suppliers, facilities, and customers
- Network optimization helps optimize supply chain flows
