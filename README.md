# Prescriptive Analytics Course

Welcome to the Prescriptive Analytics course! This course introduces you to the principles and practices of prescriptive analytics—the branch of analytics that focuses on recommending actions to achieve desired outcomes.

## About This Course

Prescriptive analytics goes beyond describing what happened (descriptive) or predicting what will happen (predictive). It answers the question: **"What should we do?"**

This course covers:
- Decision-first thinking and how models recommend while humans decide
- The analytics continuum and how prescriptive analytics builds on descriptive and predictive analytics
- Objectives, constraints, and tradeoffs in decision-making
- How to structure problems for prescriptive analytics
- Methods and techniques for optimization and decision support
- Real-world applications and case studies

## Course Philosophy

**"Models recommend; humans decide and explain."**

Prescriptive analytics is a tool to support decision-making, not replace it. Throughout this course, you'll learn to:
- Structure decision problems clearly
- Define objectives and constraints explicitly
- Interpret and evaluate recommendations
- Explain decisions to stakeholders
- Recognize when models are appropriate and when they're not

## Lessons
