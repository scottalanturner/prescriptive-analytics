# Lesson 10: Nonlinear Optimization

Welcome to Lesson 10 of Prescriptive Analytics! This lesson introduces nonlinear optimization, where relationships between variables are not linear.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

- **Linear vs Nonlinear**: The difference between linear and nonlinear relationships
- **Diminishing Returns**: How nonlinear models capture diminishing returns and economies of scale
- **Interpreting Nonlinear Models**: How to understand and validate nonlinear optimization results
- **When to Use Nonlinear Models**: When nonlinear models are necessary versus when linear approximations suffice

## Core Concepts

### 1. Linear vs Nonlinear
- **Linear**: Relationships are proportional (doubling input doubles output)
- **Nonlinear**: Relationships are not proportional (diminishing returns, economies of scale)
- Many real-world relationships are nonlinear

### 2. Diminishing Returns
- Nonlinear models capture diminishing returns
- Additional effort yields decreasing marginal benefits
- Understanding diminishing returns helps set realistic expectations

### 3. Interpreting Nonlinear Models
- Nonlinear solutions can be more complex to interpret
- Local optima may exist (multiple good solutions)
- Validation is critical for nonlinear models

### 4. When to Use Nonlinear Models
- Nonlinear models are necessary when relationships are truly nonlinear
- Linear approximations may suffice when nonlinearity is weak
- Tradeoffs between model accuracy and complexity

## Notebooks

This lesson includes four interactive Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and includes extensive explanations, code examples, and visualizations.

### Notebook 1: Linear vs Nonlinear
**File**: `lesson10_concept01_linear_vs_nonlinear.ipynb`

This notebook introduces the difference between linear and nonlinear relationships. You'll learn:
- What makes a relationship linear versus nonlinear
- Examples of linear and nonlinear relationships
- How to identify which type applies to your problem

**Key Learning**: Linear relationships are proportional; nonlinear relationships are not. Many real-world relationships are nonlinear, requiring nonlinear models.

### Notebook 2: Diminishing Returns
**File**: `lesson10_concept02_diminishing_returns.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates how nonlinear models capture diminishing returns. You'll see:
- How diminishing returns work
- How nonlinear models represent diminishing returns
- Why understanding diminishing returns matters

**Key Learning**: Nonlinear models capture diminishing returns, where additional effort yields decreasing marginal benefits. Understanding this helps set realistic expectations.

### Notebook 3: Interpreting Nonlinear Models
**File**: `lesson10_concept03_interpreting_nonlinear_models.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates how to interpret nonlinear optimization results. You'll learn:
- How nonlinear solutions differ from linear solutions
- How to identify local optima
- How to validate nonlinear solutions

**Key Learning**: Nonlinear solutions can be more complex to interpret. Local optima may exist, and validation is critical for nonlinear models.

### Notebook 4: When to Use Nonlinear Models
**File**: `lesson10_concept04_when_to_use_nonlinear_models.ipynb`

This notebook explores when nonlinear models are necessary. You'll see:
- When nonlinear models are required
- When linear approximations suffice
- Tradeoffs between model accuracy and complexity

**Key Learning**: Nonlinear models are necessary when relationships are truly nonlinear. Linear approximations may suffice when nonlinearity is weak, balancing accuracy and complexity.
