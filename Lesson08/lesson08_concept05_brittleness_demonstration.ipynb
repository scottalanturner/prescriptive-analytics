    "This notebook demonstrates **brittleness** - when models work in theory but fail when conditions change slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding brittleness helps you:\n",
    "- See how over-constraining makes models fragile\n",
    "- Understand why models break with small changes\n",
    "- Learn how to build robust models with soft constraints\n",

    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brittleness** means models that break with small changes:\n",
    "- Over-constraining makes models brittle\n",
    "- Too many hard constraints create a very small solution space\n",
    "- Small changes push the model outside this space, making it infeasible\n",
    "- Robust models can handle small changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "- Real-world conditions are never exactly what models assume\n",
    "- Brittle models fail in implementation\n",
    "- Robust models work in real-world conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical insight**: Over-constraining makes models brittle. Using soft constraints instead of hard constraints makes models more robust and useful in practice.\n"
