        "- Time cannot be stretched, compressed, or ignored\n",
        "- Dependencies create sequences that must be respected\n",

        "**Time Constraints** are hard boundaries:\n",
        "- Deadlines: tasks must finish by a specific time\n",
        "- Time windows: tasks can only occur within specific periods\n",
        "- Durations: tasks take a fixed amount of time\n",
        "- Cannot be violated without making the schedule infeasible\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dependencies** define sequences:\n",
        "- Task A must finish before Task B can start\n",
        "- Create chains of tasks that must happen in order\n",
        "- Violating dependencies makes schedules impossible to execute\n",
        "\n",
        "**Critical Path** is the sequence of tasks that determines minimum schedule duration:\n",
        "- The longest path through dependent tasks\n",
        "- Any delay on the critical path delays the entire schedule\n",
