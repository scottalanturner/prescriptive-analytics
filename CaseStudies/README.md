# Case Studies — Prescriptive Analytics in Practice

This folder contains supporting materials for **Week 5**, when the course shifts from isolated concepts to how prescriptive analytics is used in real organizations.

## Case Studies

### Harvest Hope Food Bank

A practitioner-oriented case study of a nonprofit that used an optimization model to allocate a limited marketing budget across promotional options in order to maximize donations. The reading walks through the decision problem, objectives and constraints, model structure, and how results were interpreted and communicated. It illustrates decision variables, objectives, and constraints in a real setting and introduces the idea of integer programming (e.g., run a promotion or don’t) in context.

### Optimization Tradecraft

A paper by experienced practitioners on the “tradecraft” of prescriptive analytics—what actually goes wrong and what matters when organizations use optimization to support decisions. It emphasizes decision framing, model design choices, communication with stakeholders, organizational adoption, and common failure modes. The focus is on lessons learned and practical advice rather than math or algorithms.

Together, the two readings show a full applied case (Harvest Hope) and the broader reasons prescriptive analytics projects succeed or fail (Tradecraft), reinforcing that prescriptive analytics is as much about people and decisions as it is about models.
