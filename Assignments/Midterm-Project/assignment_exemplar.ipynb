    "\n",
    "**Student Name:** Course Instructor (Exemplar)\n",
    "**Date:** February 2025\n",
    "**Chosen context:** Marketing – ad spend across channels\n",
    "**Field:** Marketing / Digital advertising\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You will choose a resource allocation problem in your field, create a synthetic dataset with **8–10 options**, build a **multi-constraint optimization model**, explore **near-optimal alternatives**, run deep sensitivity analysis and validation, then respond to **two stakeholder changes of mind**. The deliverable is one notebook with clear documentation and an executive summary suitable to hand off to a manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Build a multi-constraint continuous LP in PuLP (budget cap, category coverage, concentration cap)\n",
    "- Diagnose and handle infeasibility when constraints interact\n",
    "- Identify near-optimal alternative solutions and explain why they might be preferred\n",
    "- Perform sensitivity analysis across 5 parameters at ±20% and ±40%\n",
    "- Apply extreme value testing and one additional what-if scenario\n",
    "- Validate the solution with sanity checks and a fragile vs. robust assessment\n",
    "- Respond to two stakeholder changes of mind with updated models and a three-way comparison\n",
    "- Communicate findings in an executive summary suitable for a non-technical decision-maker"

    "1. **option** — a name or label for each option (e.g. \"Channel_A\", \"Program_ICU\")\n",
    "2. **category** — which of exactly **3 logical groups** this option belongs to (e.g. \"Paid\", \"Organic\", \"Brand\"). Every option must belong to one group. You must have at least one option per group.\n",
    "3. **benefit_rate** — the expected return per unit allocated. This is the coefficient in your objective function. Use a decimal (e.g. 0.04 = 4 cents returned per dollar spent).\n",
    "4. **[your_field_column]** — one additional numeric attribute meaningful in your field (e.g. `quality_score`, `risk_rating`, `reach_index`). Rename this column to match your context.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also set **three global constraint values** in your code (not in the CSV):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `budget_total` — total resource available (e.g. $50,000 or 2,000 staff-hours)\n",
    "- `min_alloc_per_category` — minimum each of the 3 categories must receive (ensures balanced portfolio)\n",
    "- `concentration_cap` — maximum fraction any single option can receive (e.g. 0.35 = no option gets more than 35% of the total budget)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feasibility check before you start:** Confirm that `min_alloc_per_category × 3 < budget_total` and `concentration_cap × budget_total > min_alloc_per_category`. If not, your model will be infeasible immediately — adjust the values.\n",

    "**Step-by-step LLM prompt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a **new** conversation with ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot.\n",
    "2. Say: \"I need a synthetic dataset for a prescriptive analytics portfolio allocation problem. I will use Python with pandas and PuLP. I need the output as **CSV only**.\"\n",
    "3. Tell it your field: \"I am modeling [your decision, e.g. 'marketing ad spend across channels'].\"\n",
    "4. Say: \"Create a CSV with **exactly [8, 9, or 10] rows** and these exact columns: `option` (name), `category` (one of exactly 3 groups — use these names: [name your 3 groups]), `benefit_rate` (decimal, e.g. 0.02 to 0.09, realistic for my context), `[your_field_column]` (numeric, realistic). Use realistic but simple numbers. Also give me three constraint values: `budget_total`, `min_alloc_per_category`, `concentration_cap`. Output only the CSV and the three values; no other text.\"\n",

    "**Instructions:** Based on the tornado chart and the sensitivity table, identify the single most critical parameter.

    "**Why it matters most:** In the tornado chart (Figure 2), budget_total shows the largest range in objective value when varied at ±20% and ±40%. A higher budget directly allows more total benefit; a cut forces the model to sacrifice benefit and reallocate. Other parameters (e.g. concentration_cap, min_alloc_per_category) also matter but move the objective less over the same percentage range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the decision-maker should do:** Monitor confirmed budget and any mid-quarter revisions. If budget is likely to drop by more than ~20%, run the model with the new budget and communicate the impact on expected benefit and recommended allocation before the change is locked in."

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Test what happens at the **absolute plausible limits** — not just ±40%, but the true worst-case and best-case values for your **most critical parameter** (the one you identified in Section 3.3). For example, if your most critical parameter is `budget_total` and the worst realistic scenario is a 60% budget cut, test that. Record whether the model stays Optimal or becomes Infeasible at the extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** The code below tests `budget_total` by default. If your most critical parameter is *not* `budget_total` (e.g. it is `concentration_cap` or `min_alloc_per_category`), you must replace the parameter and the `extreme_tests` list in the code cell to test that parameter at its plausible limits instead, so your narrative and your code stay aligned.\n",

    "**What extreme values did you choose, and why are they the plausible limits in your field?** We test budget_total at 40%, 60%, 100%, and 150% of base. A 60% cut represents a severe mid-year reduction; 50% increase could reflect a one-time boost or carryover. These bracket the plausible range for quarterly marketing budget changes."

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Write a professional summary suitable for presenting to a decision-maker who will not read the code. Complete all subsections below. The total length should be **400–700 words**. No placeholder text or [TODO] may remain in your final submission.

    "### Decision and Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses how to allocate a $50,000 quarterly marketing budget across nine channels (Paid, Organic, Brand) to maximize total expected benefit. The model recommends putting the most budget into the highest benefit-rate channels (e.g. Channel_D, Channel_G) until the 35% concentration cap binds, while meeting a $5,000 minimum per category and the total budget cap. As shown in Figure 1, the base solution uses the full budget and respects all three constraints: budget cap (hard), category coverage (hard), and concentration cap (hard).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Near-Optimal Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Two near-optimal alternatives were explored: one capping the top channel at 70% of its base allocation, the other capping the second-highest channel. Both stay within a few percent of the optimal objective. A stakeholder might prefer one of these if they value diversification or want to limit dependence on a single channel. Figure 1 illustrates the base allocation by option and category.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity and Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 shows that budget_total is the most critical parameter: its ±20% and ±40% variation moves the objective more than the other four parameters. The decision-maker should monitor confirmed budget and any mid-quarter changes. Extreme value testing showed that the model stays feasible even at 40% of base budget; below that, category minimums can conflict with the budget and require policy adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholder Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Change 1 required a minimum $8,000 for Channel_C; the model remained feasible and reallocated with a small drop in benefit. Change 2 minimized spending subject to 90% of base benefit; the solution uses less than the full budget. Figure 3 compares base, Change 1, and Change 2 allocations across all channels. Neither change was infeasible, so both stakeholder requests can be accommodated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommend adopting the base allocation for the current quarter, with two conditions: (1) confirm budget with finance and re-run if it changes by more than ~20%; (2) if Channel_D (top channel) becomes unavailable, use the what-if reallocation. If the goal shifts to minimizing spend while hitting a benefit target, use the Change 2 formulation instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Model assumptions (benefit rates, minimums, cap) interact so that budget and concentration cap have the largest impact on the recommendation. Near-optimal alternatives show that multiple good solutions exist. Stakeholder changes (minimum allocation, minimize-spend objective) are handled by updating the model and re-solving; the three-way comparison (Figure 3) supports clear communication with non-technical decision-makers."
