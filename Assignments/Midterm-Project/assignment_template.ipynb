The deliverable is one notebook with clear documentation and an executive summary suitable to hand off to a manager.\n",

        "- Build a multi-constraint continuous LP in PuLP (budget cap, category coverage, concentration cap)\n",
        "- Diagnose and handle infeasibility when constraints interact\n",
        "- Identify near-optimal alternative solutions and explain why they might be preferred\n",
        "- Perform sensitivity analysis across 5 parameters at ±20% and ±40%\n",
        "- Apply extreme value testing and one additional what-if scenario\n",
        "- Validate the solution with sanity checks and a fragile vs. robust assessment\n",
        "- Respond to two stakeholder changes of mind with updated models and a three-way comparison\n",
